# The Shoppies Awards
### An app to nominate movie awards for entrepreneurs

[Check out my app here](https://ruowent.github.io/the-shoppies/)

## Final Product

The shoppies Awards app is a webpage that can search OMDB for movies, and allow the user to save up to 5 films to the nomination list.


We'd like a simple to use interface that makes it easy to:
Search OMDB and display the results (movies only)
Add a movie from the search results to our nomination list
View the list of films already nominated
Remove a nominee from the nomination list

## Features
- Search bar for users to search movies
- Display search results in real time
- Nomination List to store up to 5 movies
- Remove a nominee from the nomination list or search result
- Nomination list is visible if the user leaves the page
